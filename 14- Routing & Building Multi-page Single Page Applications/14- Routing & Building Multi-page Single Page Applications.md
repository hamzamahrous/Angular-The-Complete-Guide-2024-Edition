- In this section we will have a deep dive into **Routing** .. **What & Why ?** .. **Route Configurations** .. **Nested Routes** .. **Resolving Data & Controlling Access**.
***
- Routing means that you wanna update the UI as the user navigates through your website to feel him like there's multiple pages although angular is a single page application and also update the browser address bar.
***
- To enable routing you can use this approach or export the configurations object and also the routers array to separate files and then use them. 

`bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {`
  `providers: [`
    `provideRouter([` .. 
      `{` .. every route contains a path and a component that will be loaded when this path is active.
        `path: 'tasks',`
        `component: TasksComponent,`
      `},`
    `]),`
  `],`
`}).catch((err) => console.error(err));`

- After that you should tell angular where to render this component by using a special directive `<router-outlet />` .. by this the rendered component will be rendered under this directive.
***
  `export const routes: Routes = [`
  `{`
    `path: '',` .. default routing.
    `component: NoTaskComponent,`
  `},`
  `{`
    `path: 'tasks',`
    `component: TasksComponent,`
  `},`
    `{`
    `path: '**',` .. To catch up any error path.
    `component: NotFoundComponent,` 
  `},`
  
`];`
***
- If you tried to navigate by using a regular link with `href` attribute it would lead to the whole page being loaded again (all the files, JS files and everything) .. instead you would use the router link directive `<a routerLink="/tasks" >` by this approach angular will take over and block the browser default behavior and only render the desired component.

- If you want to add a class that will only be added if this element led to the currently active route being loaded you can use another special directive `RouterLinkActive='selected'`.
***
- The dynamic routing refers to routes that are created based on dynamic values or data passed at runtime and you can define it like this `path: 'users/:userId'` (By adding a colon and then an identifier that can be any name but you will use it later).

- `[routerLink]="['/users', user().id]"` .. you can use this approach to add the path as parts some of them are hardcoded and some are dynamic values and angular will collapse them for you and add the slash between them or you also can just concatenate strings normally.
***
**First Approach to get hold of this dynamic data (Input Binding)**

- To tell angular that you want to have this input binding approach enabled .. you should call the function `withComponentInputBinding` inside the config file .. 
  `providers: [provideRouter(router, withComponentInputBinding())]`

- And by using this approach you can now inside the component that will be active have an input (with the same identifier that you used inside the dynamic routing `userId`) which will now automatically have the value of the dynamic routing part.
***
**Second Approach**

- Another approach to hold this dynamic data .. first inject the `ActivatedRoute` service which gives you some subjects (observables) which you can subscribe to them to get notified when there's changes in the URL.

  `ngOnInit(): void {`
    `const subscription = this.activatedRoute.paramMap.subscribe({`
      `next: (paramMap) => {`
        `this.userName =`
          `this.usersService.users.find((u) => u.id === paramMap.get('userId'))` .. `userId` has to be the same identifier name that was used with the dynamic routing ... also note that `paramMap` has `get` method which allows you to extract one of it's key value pairs.
            `?.name || '';`
      `},`
    `});`
    `this.destroyRef.onDestroy(() => subscription.unsubscribe());`
  `}` 
***
 - Nested Routes are used to render a component inside a component that was rendered because of another route.

`export const router: Routes = [`
  `{`
    `path: '',`
    `component: NoTaskComponent,`
  `},`
  `{`
    `path: 'users/:userId',`
    `component: UserTasksComponent,`
    `children: [`
      `{`
        `path: 'tasks',` .. note that the path will be concatenated to the parent.
        `component: TasksComponent,`
      `},`
      `{`
        `path: 'tasks/new',`
        `component: NewTaskComponent,`
      `},`
    `],`
  `};`
`];`

- Then you have to add the directive `<router-outlet>` again inside the parent component so the nested children routes will be rendered under it.

- Also when you use the `routerLink` inside the nested component and add some link it will be concatenated to the parent link.
***
- To have access to the parent path dynamic parts .. you need to tell angular as it won't be enabled by default .. and to tell angular you should add `withRouterConfig()` .. or you can use the `ActivatedRoute` approach normally.

`export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {`
  `providers: [`
    `provideRouter(`
      `router,`
      `withComponentInputBinding(),`
      `withRouterConfig({`
        `paramsInheritanceStrategy: 'always',` -> To make these values inherited.
      `})`
    `),`
  `],`
`};` .. after that you can have now input with the name `userId` and it will have the value automatically just like the case for the parent.
***
- If you need to perform programmatic navigation (Like when the user click on some button) do some navigation you would first inject `Router` and use it to navigate inside the `onSubmit` method for example.

  `this.router.navigate(['/users', this.userId(), 'tasks'], {`
      `replaceUrl: true,` .. you need this to prevent the user from going to the previous page by actually replacing the URL.
    `});`
  `}`

- Note that you can't use `routerLink` here because it's a button not a `a`.
***
- You maybe sometimes want when some URL is entered to redirect the user to different URL .. 

    `children: [`
      `{`
        `path: '',`
        `redirectTo: 'tasks',`
        `pathMatch: 'prefix',` .. you can set it to `full` instead of `prefix`.
      `},` .. The `pathMatch: prefix` means that if the entered path starts with this path combined with the parent path the redirect will be activated .. unlike the `full` which won't be activated unless the entered path equals this path combined with the parent path exactly not just started with it.
***
- Note that you can divide the routes file into different files to make things lean as much as possible.
***
- Note that `activatedRoute` object has a `snapshot` property which hold the same properties of the `activatedRoute` but the difference is that they aren't observables instead they are holding the actual values .. and that will make a big difference as now the code won't be re-excuted because `ngOnInit` won't be re-excuted and you aren't subscribing to some observable .. so you might consider use it in the case when you need to read the value just one time.
***
- `routerLink = "./"` to make this hold the link that you are in now.
***
- `queryParams` are these extra pieces of information's that you can add to the URL .. they come after a question mark and you can add any key value pairs ... and angular make it easy to add and extract these values. 

`<a routerLink="./" [queryParams]="{ order: 'asc' }">`

- To extract the currently active `queryParams` you mainly have the same two ways ... First if you already enabled the `componentInputBinding()` you can simply add a new property to your component with the same name `order`.

- The second approach will be to use the `activatedRoute` ... `this.activatedRoute.queryParams.subscribe({})` .. and use this subscription to update some variable.
***
 `{`
    `path: 'users/:userId',`
    `component: UserTasksComponent,`
    `children: usersRoutes,`
    `data: {`
      `message: 'Hello!'`
  `}` .. this how you can send a static data to your component .. and again you can receive these data by the two main ways.
***
 **Now how can we send dynamic data ?**

- To send dynamic data you would use `resolve` which works like `data` but for dynamic data ... the key will be any value from your choice but the value must be valid angular resolvers .. which are simply functions in modern angular.

`resolve: {`
  `userName: resolveUserName,` .. now to get access to this `userName` it would by typically by the same two ways by having input with this name inside the class ... or you can use the `activatedRoute` by accessing it's `data` property which is an observable which will hold an object contains both of the static & dynamic data.
`},`

 `export const resolveUserName: ResolveFn<string> = (` .. we used this shape of function to be able to add a shape to it.
  `activatedRoute: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,` 
  `routerState: RouterStateSnapshot` .. you will always need to pass those two values.
`) => {`
  `const usersService = inject(UsersService);` .. angular allows you to inject values into the functions because this resolver is outside the class so it doesn't have access to the data injected inside the class.
  `const userName =`
    `usersService.users.find(`
      `(u) => u.id === activatedRoute.paramMap.get('userId')`
    `)?.name || '';`
  `return userName;` .. you need to return some value.
`};` 

- Note that this resolver function will be called for every navigation action so there's no meaning to set up a subscription.
***
- `runGuardsAndResolvers: 'paramsOrQueryParamsChange'` .. To decide when the resolvers should run .. you can set it to `'always` also.
***
- When you navigate throw your webpage you might want to update the page title also and to do this you can use `title` property which can accept static data or resolved functions.
***
- `Route Guards` is used to guard the route and it's children to prevent any one from accessing the route ... to guard them you can use `canMatch` property which checks if the entered route can match this route or you can use `canActivate` which will check if this component can be activated after it's already matched .. but before the component is loaded.

`const dummyCanMatch: CanMatchFn = (route, segments) => {` .. route holds information's about the route .. and segments hold the path segments. 
  `const router = inject(Router);`
  `const shouldGetAccess = Math.random();`
  `if (shouldGetAccess < 0.5) return true;`
  `return new RedirectCommand(router.parseUrl('/unauthorized'));`
`};` .. these functions should return true or false (which will look like the app failed) or typically you would want to redirect the user by returning `new RedirectCommand()` .. which should take a `URLTree` and you can do this by using this `parseUrl` property from the injected router.

 `canMatch: [dummyCanMatch]`


- `canDeactivate` is used to determine whether it's allowed to leave this page or not .. or you can use it ask the user if he's sure to leave.

- Note that it takes the component it will be worked with `<component>`
`export const canLeaveEditPage: CanDeactivateFn<NewTaskComponent> = (component) => {`
  `if (`
    `component.enteredDate() || component.enteredSummary() || component.enteredTitle()`
  `) {`
    `return window.confirm(`
      `'Do you really want to leave ? you will lose the entered data'`
    `);`
  `}`
  `return true;`
`};` .. note that this code here have a bug but just see the idea.
***
- Now after adding all this resolvers the tasks aren't reloaded .. and to solve this we want to redirect to the same URL we are in to make the resolver function which loads the tasks triggered again ... 

 `onComplete() {`
    `this.tasksService.removeTask(this.task().id);`
    `this.route.navigate(['./'], {`
      `relativeTo: this.activatedRoute,`
      `onSameUrlNavigation: 'reload',` .. as the default to ignore the load to the same URL.
      `queryParamsHandling: 'preserve',` .. to not delete `queryParams`.
    `});`
  `}`
