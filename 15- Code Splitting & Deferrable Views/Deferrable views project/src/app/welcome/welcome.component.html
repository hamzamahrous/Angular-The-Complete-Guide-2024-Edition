    <h2>Build Web Apps With Angular!</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Angular is one of the most popular modern web development frameworks out
    there!
  </p>
  <p>
    It's getting used by thousands of developers and companies since it allows
    developers to build powerful, highly interactive web applications with ease!
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst you could use "just JavaScript" to build such applications, Angular
    vastly simplifies the process and allows you to build applications with a
    clear, modular structure - a feature that's especially important as
    applications become more complex.
