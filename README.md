# Angular Study Journey

This repository documents my progress and learnings from the **"Angular - The Complete Guide 2024"** course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. 

## Repository Structure

- **Demo Applications:**  
  Live examples of the Angular projects I built during the course.
  
- **Study Notes:**  
  Each section of the course has its own folder containing the notes and code snippets. These notes detail what I've learned and important concepts covered in that part of the course.

## Notes

- The repository will be continuously updated as I progress through the course.
- At the end of the course, this README will be updated to reflect the complete list of concepts and skills I've learned.
